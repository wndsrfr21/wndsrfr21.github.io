Hello from New York today! Wish you were here :)

<insert NYC image>

This tutorial is the first in a multipart series where we explore an API from the point of someone who has some development background and would like to test out an API. The person would likely be interested in the following:
- API limitations/requirements
- Usage of API in NodeJS, C++, Python or other programming languages
- Usage of API for processors other than x86 (Intel) 
- Usage of API for IOT / embedded hardware applications 
- Just want to send a @#^!&%&#@^ing SMS to a cell phone without confusing documentation or unanswered emails from support or having to create 50 lines of code just to test a single API

An additional goal of this series is to help the non-developers with the following:
- Thought process of a developer
- Evolution of code as it matures
- Development tools common to 2017 development environments (Linux environment is different from Windows is different from MacOS is different from embedded)
- 

My goal is to cover as many languages and hardware combinations as possible so that you can see the same code in multiple environments thus providing a well rounded view of how the code changes from platform to platform as well as the necessary tools. For the different types of code, I have split up the code in the following phases to 

Kandy SMS API - Phase 1 - Python - https://github.com/wndsrfr21/KandySMSPython
Kandy SMS API - Phase 1 - NodeJS - 
Kandy SMS API - Phase 1 - C++ - TBA
Kandy SMS API - Phase 1 - HTTP Interface w/ Webtask.io - 
Kandy SMS API Library - C++ - https://github.com/aharshac/KandyCpp/wiki
Kandy SMS API in Python w/ Facial Recognition - TBA
